Hi! I'm Ian, a 21 year old American who has recently graduated from college. I intend for this website to become a place for me to share my writing, which so far has been aimed at recollecting recent travel stories.

Although the format of this website is subject to change as I figure out what works best, I encourage you to take a peek around at what I have right now. Thanks for visiting!
