Give three sentences in English together with translations into our formal language. The sentences should be chosen so as to have an interesting structure, and the translations should each contain 15 or more symbols.

We let $$A,B,\ldots,Z$$ be the first 26 sentence symbols.

**English Sentence 1:**
If someone is a cowboy, then they ride a horse, herd cattle, live in the American southwest, and drink whiskey.

Translation of sentence symbols:
$$C = \textrm{a person is a cowboy}$$
$$R = \textrm{the person rides a horse}$$
$$H = \textrm{the person herds cattle}$$
$$A = \textrm{the person lives in the American southwest}$$
$$W = \textrm{the person drinks whiskey}$$

Translations of the english sentence:
$$(C\to (R\land(H\land(A\land W))))$$

**English Sentence 2:**
If the suspect is guilty of an offense and either the suspect is not a previous offender or the offense is not severe, then their punishment is less harsh.

Translation of sentence symbols:
$$G = \textrm{the suspect is guilty of an offense}$$ 
$$P = \textrm{the suspect is a previous offender}$$
$$S = \textrm{the offense is severe}$$ 
$$L = \textrm{the punishment is less harsh}$$ 

Translation of the english sentence:
$$((G\land ((\lnot P)\lor (\lnot S)))\to L)$$ 

**English Sentence 3:**
