## Part (a)
### Problem
Show that if $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$ are truth assignments which agree on all the sentence symbols in the wff $$\alpha$$, then $$\overline{v}_1(\alpha) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha$$). Use the induction principle.
### Solution
Let $$S$$ be the set of wffs for which $$\overline{v}_1$$ and $$\overline{v}_2$$ agree. Since $$\overline{v}_i$$ is an extension of $$v_i$$, and since $$v_1(A_k) = v_2(A_k)$$ for all sentence symbols $$A_k$$ in $$\alpha$$, all the sentence symbols in $$\alpha$$ are contained in $$S$$. Consider $$\beta$$ and $$\gamma$$ some wffs in $$S$$. 

Notice that, by the rules established for the extensions $$\overline{v}_i$$, we must have that \begin{gather}\overline{v}_1((\lnot\beta)) = \begin{cases} T & \text{if} & \overline{v}_1(\beta) = F \\ F & \text{if} & \overline{v}_1(\beta) = T\end{cases}\end{gather}
and similarly, \begin{gather}\overline{v}_2((\lnot\beta)) = \begin{cases} T & \text{if} & \overline{v}_2(\beta) = F \\ F & \text{if} & \overline{v}_2(\beta) = T\end{cases}\end{gather}
But since $$\overline{v}_1(\beta) = \overline{v}_2(\beta)$$, these functions must coincide so that $$\overline{v}_1((\lnot\beta)) = \overline{v}_2((\lnot\beta))$$ 
Thus, $$(\lnot\beta)\in S$$. 

By the same process and logic, we also have that $$(\beta\square\gamma)\in S$$ where $$\square$$ is one of $$\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow$$, so that $$S$$ is closed under the sentence building operations. By the induction principle, $$S$$ contains all wffs made from the sentence symbols in $$\alpha$$. Namely, $$S$$ contains $$\alpha$$, so that $$\overline{v}_1(\alpha)=\overline{v}_2(\alpha)$$.

## Part (b)
### Problem
Let $$S$$ be a set of sentence symbols that includes those in $$\Sigma$$ and $$\tau$$ (and possibly more). Show that $$\Sigma\vDash\tau$$ if and only if every truth assignment for $$S$$ which satisfies every member of $$\Sigma$$ also satisfies $$\tau$$.
### Solution
First, let $$S'$$ denote the set of sentence symbols that appear in $$\Sigma$$ and $$\tau$$, and no more. So $$S'\subseteq S$$.

"$$\Rightarrow$$"
For the forwards direction, we assume that $$\Sigma\vDash\tau$$. Now, let $$v$$ be a truth assignment for $$S$$ which satisfies every member of $$\Sigma$$. The domain of $$v$$ can be restricted to $$S'\subseteq S$$, call this new assignment $$v_0$$. Since $$v_0$$ still satisfies every member of $$\Sigma$$ and $$\Sigma\vDash\tau$$, we have that $$v_0$$ satisfies $$\tau$$. Now since $$v$$ and $$v_0$$ agree on all the sentence symbols in $$\tau$$, by part (a) we have that $$\overline{v}(\tau)=\overline{v}_0(\tau)= T$$. Thus, $$v$$ satisfies $$\tau$$.

"$$\Leftarrow$$"
Now I prove the backwards direction.
Let $$v$$ be a truth assignment for $$S'$$ which satisfies $$\Sigma$$. Extend the domain of $$v$$, calling the new assignment $$v'$$, to take on all the symbols of $$S$$ by the following: \begin{gather}v'(A) = \begin{cases} v(A) & \text{if} & A\in \Sigma\cup\{\tau\} \\ T & \text{otherwise} & \end{cases}\end{gather}
Notice that since $$v'$$ and $$v$$ agree on all sentence symbols in $$\Sigma$$, $$\overline{v}'$$ and $$\overline{v}$$ agree on every member of $$\Sigma$$ (by part (a)). Since $$v$$ satisfies $$\Sigma$$. By our assumption $$v'$$ must also satisfies $$\tau$$. Since $$v$$ and $$v'$$ agree on all sentence symbols in $$\tau$$, we must have that $$\overline{v}(\tau)=\overline{v}'(\tau) = T$$ (by part (a)). Since $$v$$ was an arbitrary truth assignment, we have that $$\Sigma\vDash\tau$$.
