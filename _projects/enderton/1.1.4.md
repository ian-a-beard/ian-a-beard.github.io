Assume we have a construction sequence ending in $$\varepsilon_n$$, where $$\varepsilon_n$$ does not contain the symbol $$A_4$$. Suppose we delete all the expressions in the construction sequence that contain $$A_4$$. Show that the result is still a legal construction sequence.

Let $$C = \langle \varepsilon_1,\ldots,\varepsilon_n\rangle$$ be the construction sequence.
Let $$C' = \langle \varepsilon_{k_1},\ldots,\varepsilon_{k_m}\rangle$$ be the same sequence but with all expressions containing $$A_4$$ deleted and re-indexed. We have that $$m\geq 1$$ since $$\varepsilon_n$$ does not contain $$A_4$$, and that $$\varepsilon_{k_m} = \varepsilon_n$$ 

Consider $$\varepsilon_{k_i}$$ an arbitrary element in the sequence $$C'$$. Since $$\varepsilon_{k_i}$$ is also a member of the original construction sequence $$C$$, we have the following three cases to consider.
###### Case 1: $$\varepsilon_{k_i}=\varepsilon_\lnot(\varepsilon_{j})$$ for some $$j < k_i$$  
Since $$\varepsilon_{k_i}$$ contains no $$A_4$$ symbol and the operation of logical negation does not add an $$A_4$$ symbol, it must be that $$\varepsilon_j$$ does not contain $$A_4$$ either. Thus, $$\varepsilon_j$$ is present in the sequence $$C'$$, meaning $$\varepsilon_{k_i} = \varepsilon_\lnot(\varepsilon_{k_r})$$ for some $$r < i$$ 

###### Case 2: $$\varepsilon_{k_i} = \varepsilon_\square(\varepsilon_j,\varepsilon_r)$$ for some $$j,r<k_i$$, where $$\square$$ is one of $$\to,\leftrightarrow,\land,\lor$$ 
Since $$\varepsilon_{k_i}$$ contains no $$A_4$$ symbol, and the operation $$\varepsilon_\square(\cdot,\cdot)$$ does not introduce an $$A_4$$ symbol, it must be that $$\varepsilon_j$$ and $$\varepsilon_r$$ do not contain $$A_4$$. Thus, $$\varepsilon_j$$ and $$\varepsilon_r$$ are present in the sequence $$C'$$, meaning $$\varepsilon_{k_i} = \varepsilon_\square(\varepsilon_{k_s},\varepsilon_{k_p})$$ where $$s,p < i$$.

###### Case 3: $$\varepsilon_{k_i}$$ is a sentence symbol
This case requires no further attention, we already know it does not contain $$A_4$$

From considering the arbitrary symbol $$\varepsilon_{k_i}$$ from $$C$$ as a member of its parent sequence $$C'$$, we see that it follows the rules established for legal construction sequences. Thus, $$C'$$ is a legal sequence.
