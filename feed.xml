On my last full day before leaving I summited the nearby Canigou mountain. I had been fixing to hike it during my stay, but it wasn’t until the last day that both the weather and my confidence aligned and I finally gave it a shot. The day hike ended up being my longest so far, totaling 28.4 miles (45.7 km). I began early in the morning in order to finish before sundown. In total, it took me 12 hours and 53 minutes to complete. Here is a sequence of photos I took which illustrate the endeavor.</p> <h3 id="hiking-pic-du-canigou">Hiking Pic du Canigou</h3> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/picducanigou/1.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/picducanigou/1.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/picducanigou/1.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/picducanigou/1.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Setting out. 4:10 A.M.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/picducanigou/2.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/picducanigou/2.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/picducanigou/2.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/picducanigou/2.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/picducanigou/3.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/picducanigou/3.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/picducanigou/3.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/picducanigou/3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>It’s pitch black outside.

This included a visit to Thailand which lasted sixteen days. Half of those I spent in Pai, a small town in the north of the country. There are several publicly known waterfalls in Pai. Of them, I saw the Mae Yen Waterfall, which I discovered in my search for a long day-hike in the area. Here is the story of that hike, which I set out for on the morning of September 2, 2024.</p> <h3 id="hike-to-mae-yen-waterfall">Hike to Mae Yen Waterfall</h3> <p>The morning starts like many others in Pai. I wake up in my hostel bed and, after a few moments, stumble outside in my flip-flops and shorts to a sleepy Pai town. I begin walking down the street, turning a corner at one of the few stoplights in town so that I can visit a café for rice porridge. After eating, my belly is warm and full of rice, pork, and broth. I return to the hostel to put on some more appropriate hiking gear. Then, I head east on the road leading out of Pai, making sure to stop at 7/11 for rations.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6655-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6655-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6655-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6655.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6657-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6657-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6657-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6657.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The road out of Pai. </div> <p>To get out of town, I must cross a short, rusty white bridge. Once I do, the motorbikes on the street come fewer and farther in between. Soon, it feels like civilization has fallen away behind me. I eventually turn left onto a narrow road, where I encounter a brown dog. Panting with his tongue out, he stops in the middle of the street to study me. I pause as well for a moment, then walk forward again. He is friendly and lets me pass.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6667-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6667-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6667-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6667.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Neighborhood sentinel. </div> <p>When the road turns into a dirt path, I realize I’m at the trailhead. In my head, I do a mental checklist. The time is 12 P.M. My hike is to be 10 miles long, 5 miles out and 5 miles back. It’s just above 80 degrees fahrenheit, and there is a strong possibility of rain. Before I set off on the trail, I make sure to douse myself in mosquito repellant.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6672-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6672-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6672-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6672.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Within a few minutes of walking I appear next to the river which the trail follows. In it, I spot two other travelers standing in the stream, holding their pants up over their knees. I approach them, and we chat about what we know about the trail. For me, that’s the info from AllTrails users who have warned that to hike this trail one must cross the river some fifty to a hundred time. After crossing the stream together, my shoes have already become soaked and filled with sand. I stop to confront this new and uncomfortable sensation in my feet, as well as to turn my hiking pants into hiking shorts.</p> <p>A few minutes later, I catch back up with the couple. They are standing on the river bank watching four water buffalo in its stream. One of the buffalo is lying peacefully in the riverbed as the water curves around its body. I stand next to them and watch, too. We are charmed by these majestic bovines. I continue on the trail, while the hikers stay behind to watch the buffalo. Almost immediately afterwards there is a split in the trail. I pause to inspect it, confused, and then I notice on my right there is a Thai man sitting in a hut. When I look at him, he points me in the right direction of the trail. I smile and thank him.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6685-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6685-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6685-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6685.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Water buffalo at the river. </div> <p>As the trail narrows, I become excited, so much so that I find myself running through the jungle. I feel like Indiana Jones, and I can’t stop laughing at that thought. I hear the theme from the movie’s soundtrack in my head and consider listening to music, but think better of it on account of my unfamiliarity with the terrain. This choice heightens my sensitivity to the jungle noises, and when the river becomes audible, I know I’m about to cross the river again. At the crossing, the water is shallow, only coming up to my knees at its deepest points. The cold water refreshes my shins and calves. The current is strong, but with caution I ford the river. Everything’s going off without a hitch so far.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6692-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6692-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6692-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6692.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6706-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6706-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6706-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6706.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> One of the first of many river crossings. </div> <p>After the crossing, I come across a dark, weather-stained shack on stilts in the wooded valley. It has real horror movie potential. I imagine Leatherface is up in it, sleeping with a rusty chain saw. When I discard this idea, though, I realize that what I really want to know is the more mundane history of the shelter. Who put it there and when, and for what purpose? I entertain myself with other made-up stories about it as I continue hiking.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6709-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6709-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6709-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6709.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>A little while later, I check the time; it’s 1 P.M. The river crossings have increased in difficulty, and the one I’m facing now is particularly intimidating. There are large rocks which jut out from the riverbed, and the turbulent flow of water around them has created a rapid. I attempt to hold onto the largest of these rocks for support while crossing it, but am quickly deterred from the idea once I take a closer look and discover fishing spiders inconspicuously scattered across its surface. This begins a thought process about what other wildlife lurks in the jungle. My anxiety builds as I cross the murky water.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6711-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6711-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6711-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6711.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fishing spider. </div> <p>As I hike, my mind conjures frightful images. First, I think of the five-foot monitor lizards I saw in the canals of Bangkok. A more violent image follows it, one I remember from a documentary. It’s of a child in Uganda who witnesses the maiming of her cow by a Nile crocodile after leading it to the river for a drink. In my head, I can hear the voice of Jeremy Wade, host of TV show <em>River Monsters</em>. He is describing “the goonch,” a deadly gargantuan catfish which drags people to the depths of India’s Kali river. Despite these unsettling images, I’m able to bring myself some solace by declaring that the river is too turbulent and shallow for those sorts of creatures to inhabit. The validity of such a statement is dubious, but I choose to believe it anyways.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/mae-yen-waterfall/IMG_6780.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A tricky river crossing. </div> <p>As the trail becomes increasingly difficult to follow, though, I feel a bond with the river strengthening. The trail often leads straight into the river, with no continuation on the other side. My only option is to hike upstream to rediscover the trail. In some instances, the trail is so faintly worn that I must duck under trees and push my way through jungle thickets to continue. I am blissfully ignorant to the sundry species of venomous snakes which are native to Thailand. These include pit vipers, banded kraits, and king cobras.</p> <p>It’s probably 1:30 P.M. and I’ve just passed three other hikers in a group coming back on the trail. They are the only other humans I encounter on the way to the waterfall. After several more river crossings, and some cursing at its rapids, I happen across a sign for a steep bypass to the waterfall. This allows me to hike up the side of the gulch and along its ridge, avoiding a segment of the river. As I hike up the path the sound of running water fades away. I look across the valley towards the opposing ridge through the trees, releasing the tension I carried along the river. I even stop to study a line of ants busily flowing across the trail.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6731-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6731-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6731-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6731.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/mae-yen-waterfall/IMG_6743.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The bypass eventually leads me back down to the river. Like before, I follow it upstream. In the surrounding land, I discover the tracks of what are presumably water buffalo. Additionally, I begin to hear the waterfall. My steady footsteps along the trail guarantee a crescendo of crashing water, and after rounding one last bend, the fall comes into view. It cascades three tiers down into a small reservoir, feeding the river. It’s 2:30 P.M. and I’ve gotten as close as I can. Sitting on a large boulder, I eat my snacks and watch the falling water. Nobody else appears.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/mae-yen-waterfall/IMG_6751.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/mae-yen-waterfall/IMG_6770.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Mae Yen Waterfall. </div> <p>I appreciate the waterfall for a few moments longer before heading back on the trail in order to conserve daylight. The couple who was hiking behind me hasn’t appeared yet, and I assume they have given up and turned around before reaching the waterfall. I follow the bypass back up to the valley’s ridge. After descending to the river, I accidentally I hike downstream too far, missing where the trail picks up on the left-hand side. I lose several minutes in the process of backtracking. Once I rediscover the trail, though, I am able to stay on it for the rest of the way, recrossing all the same rapids.</p> <p>In the jungle, I pause to look at what I initially thought was an unremarkable piece of rock sitting atop a tree stump. Upon closer inspection, an eroded figure of the Buddha reveals itself. Then, during one of my river crossings, I stop to examine a yellow frog sitting on a rock in the river.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/P9020811-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/P9020811-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/P9020811-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/P9020811.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/P9020814-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/P9020814-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/P9020814-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/P9020814.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> 1: A broken Buddha. 2: A yellow frog sits on a rock in the river. </div> <p>Eventually I make it back to the wide and well-trodden dirt path at the beginning of the trail.

A young man and woman are picking fruits from a tree on the side of the road. Sunset is approaching as I walk along the road towards the thoroughfare. I become excited at the thought of telling my friend I made in town that I successfully completed the hike. Along the local road, I stop several times to admire the rice fields, as well as the cattle milling about.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/P9020822-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/P9020822-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/P9020822-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/P9020822.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_6816-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMG_6816-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMG_6816-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_6816.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/P9020839-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/P9020839-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/P9020839-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/P9020839.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Rice fields and cattle. </div> <p>Once back on the main road, I recross the bridge, walk past the 7/11, and turn down the alley towards my hostel.

Sitting on a bench outside the dorm I kick off my shoes and peel away my wet socks, shaking the sand out. I’m tired, have a headache, and am soaked with sweat and river water. I am delighted to find, however, that I only gained a few mosquito bites during the hike. Once I take a shower and have some food from the street market, I feel calm and content.

In the state of Colorado, there are 58 “14ers,” and up until two weeks ago I had hiked 0 of them. One of the most famous peaks in Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak, is a 14er too, and several members of my family have hiked it. When back home in Ohio, my aunt and I would enthusiastically discuss our plans to take on the challenge and eventually hike some 14ers ourselves. Indeed, hiking a 14er is more tiresome then lower altitude summits because it can easily cause altitude sickness. This was the perfect kind of challenge for me to take on now that I had finished college. Thus, when it came time to decide what to do for my 21st birthday, I knew I had to finally hike a 14er.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="quandary-peak">Quandary Peak</h3> <p>On the day of my birthday at 4:30 AM I, as well as my parents, cousin, uncle, and my uncle’s dog Tora, woke up and got ready with haste to head for the mountain in my uncle’s truck. Towards the end of our half hour drive to the trailhead, there was a big commotion when a deer crossed the street and collided with the front of the truck. The deer was no longer, and my dad and uncle got out to drag it off the road while my mom and cousin inspected the truck for damage. Nonetheless, we piled back into the truck for the remaining few minutes of our drive.</p> <p>After parking and double checking our gear, we started on foot towards the trail at around 5:30 AM. Once we got from the service road to the trail we began traversing steep switchbacks through the woods. It took only a few minutes until everyone was audibly aspirating. Although just minutes ago I was feeling the morning chill, I started shedding layers as to not overheat.</p> <p>My cousin, Raychel, kept discussing our eminent departure from the “tree line,” which I learned is the part of the mountain where habitable to trees. Once high enough on the mountain this arboreal veil was lifted, revealing great vistas of nearby peaks. Above the tree line the terrain was more rocky, too.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The valley next to Quandary Peak. </div> <p>Eventually, the trail leveled out before the final ascent to the summit.

Out of his pack he pulled out a beer for each for us to drink. Everyone partook, except for my mom who was already feeling dizzy. The summit was cold due to the wind and the clouds which hid the sun. We decided to stay on the cold peak for only a little longer. This gave me enough time to listen to the song “Alarm Call,” by Bjork, which I had been unofficially planning to do for months once I was on a mountain top. For those unfamiliar, the lyrics go: “I want to go to a mountain top, with a radio and good batteries, and play a joyous tune, and free the human race from suffering. It doesn’t scare me it all. I’m no fucking buddhist, but this is enlightenment.” Once the song finished we began our descent.</p> <p>On the way back down my cousin and I “glissaded,” which is where you slide down the mountain snow with your butt on the ground, kind of like sledding. The snow was tough, and it made my butt hurt quickly so I opted to go back on foot. Once we got past the rock scramble which led to the summit, I started playing music out of the speakers of my phone again. I played The Smiths, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Steely Dan, and some 80s Europop favorites of mine. I was feeling fabulous at this point, and thought I had escaped any looming threats of altitude sickness.</p> <p>Unfortunately, by the time we got back to the car I was suffering a splitting headache, and I didn’t feel right for the rest of the day. By the evening it subsided, and I spent a joyful evening playing cards with my family. I was too excited to sleep that night since I was solving a riddle that had stumped me for over a week. It was lucky I had a few days to recover before my next 14er.</p> <h3 id="humboldt-peak">Humboldt Peak</h3> <p>The next peak was Humboldt Peak, a “class II” 14er. Quandary Peak was a “class I” 14er, which are the easiest kind. The class numbers increase with respect to the hikes difficulty, which is measured by a variety of criteria including the length of the hike and exposure (i.e. the possibility of falling off the mountain).</p> <p>The day before we hiked Humboldt Peak we set up camp at in the area nearby. It had been a while since I slept in a tent, and I have to admit I was restless when we all decided to go to bed. Nonetheless, we got up at 5 AM and quickly got ready to head to the trailhead. Since my cousin was driving her truck, we were able to shorten the hike by several miles by driving up a rocky road leading to the trail.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-9-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-10-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-10-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-10-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> L: The yellow tent was mine. R: Tent fun </div> <p>After what felt like forever on that bumpy road, we got to the trailhead. After eating some last minute snacks, my uncle hooked the dog into her leash, and we set off. The beginning of the hike saw us steadily climbing a slightly narrower rocky road for a few miles. Eventually it turned onto a proper hiking trail which snaked its way through trees, meadows, and past a lake. Once we got to the lake, we decided to break for snacks as to fuel up for the push to the summit. The view was incredible. At the trailhead, we had looked at a map of the surrounding peaks so that we could put names to the mountains. My cousin was already familiar with the two most intimidating of these surrounding peaks, Crestone Peak and Crestone Needle. These are 14ers as well, but at my experience level it will remain out of reach for some time, maybe forever.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-11-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-11-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-11-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-12-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-12-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-12-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-13-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-13-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-13-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-13.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Views from the Humboldt Peak trail. </div> <p>Back to our current 14er, we finished our snacks and headed off.

In addition to this, the wind was brutal, and I felt like I had to stop at times to steady myself. My cousin called out to me and told me I was off the trail, so I retraced my steps to get back to the main path. I waited for them to reach me so that we could all summit together. This part was the most challenging. It was mildly aggravating, too, as the hike contained what’s called a “false summit,” which is a part of the mountain that <em>looks</em> like the summit but is not. Once reaching the false summit, the genuine summit, as well as the final rock scarmble, came into view. It was certainly a challenge to push through this last section.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-15-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-15-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-15-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-15.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-16-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-16-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-16-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-16.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> L: The switchback portion of the trail.

I tried not to go too close to the edge of the summit, since it was a sheer cliff on the side.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-17-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-17-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-17-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-17.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-18-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-18-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-18-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-18.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-19-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-19-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-19-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-19.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> L: The cliff at the summit.

My hiking buddies were ready to go back down, though, which was wise given the length of the hike. At the beginning of our descent I felt dizzy, and had to traverse slowly to maintain steady footing. I had a slight headache, but with a few ibuprofen and tylenol it was manageable. Once we got back to the switchbacks portion I started to feel more normal. By the time we were in the woods we were all chatting in good spirits, asking each other questions like “would you rather be eaten by a shark or by a crocodile?”</p> <p>The cumulative length of the hike ended up at 12 miles. That night, I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, and didn’t wake until I heard the morning birds chirping. The next day was devoted to rest. We enjoyed the Buena Vista hot springs and got cleaned up, then headed to a different campsite which was closer to our final 14er of the trip.</p> <h3 id="mount-antero">Mount Antero</h3> <p>Like Humboldt Peak, this hike began with us driving up a winding rocky road for several miles along a mountainside. Doing this shaved 6 miles off of the hike, but it may have shaved 6 days off my uncle’s life as well. He was not a fan of the speed and jostling at which my cousin launched us up the mountain in her truck. The dog didn’t seem to mind, though. She was fast asleep with her head in my lap during the commotion.</p> <p>This hike was straightforward, and ended up being the easiest one of them all. For starters, the hike began at 12 thousand feet of elevation, which meant that we only had to gain another 2 thousand for our 14er. The gain for Humboldt Peak was over twice that. Mount Antero’s trail began with a long portion of steady gain on a smooth gravel road, which was originally a mining road back in the day.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-20-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-20-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-20-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-20.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/14ers-21-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/14ers-21-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/14ers-21-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/14ers-21.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> L: Gearing up.

My body had become more accustomed to the lack of oxygen. The hike down was comfortable, and at this point I had caught the 14er bug. I wanted to do more of them, and even considered solo hiking the ubiquitous “Pike’s Peak” before I left Colorado. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could, as I had to hit the road for Texas. The 14ers, as well as my camping experience, was a good primer for my road trip; the trip left me feeling confident to take on the upcoming hikes I had planned at Big Bend National Park. Though I may never complete all 58 of them, I hope to hike more 14ers the next time I’m in Colorado.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="hiking"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recount my experiences hiking three mountains in Colorado]]></summary></entry></feed>
