Hi! I'm Ian, a 20 year old American who has recently graduated from college. I intend for this website to become a place for me to share my thoughts on topics such as mathematics and art history, and also on more general subjects of life which reflect my own curiosity. 

The blog tab is where I plan to post the majority of my content. Soon, it will become populated with travel updates from both an upcoming road trip around the American Southwest as well as a two month stay in Southeast Asia. The projects tab is devoted to larger scale endeavors, such as solutions to various textbook exercises.

I'm sure this website will undergo several changes as I figure out what works best, but for now I encourage you to take a peek around. Thanks for visiting!
