Consider a sequence $$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots$$ of wffs. For each wff $$\varphi$$ let $$\varphi^*$$ be the result of replacing the sentence symbol $$A_n$$ by $$\alpha_n$$ for each $$n$$.

## Part (a)
### Problem
Let $$v$$ be a truth assignment for the set of all sentence symbols; define $$u$$ to be the truth assignment for which $$u(A_n) = \overline{v}(\alpha_n)$$. Show that $$\overline{u}(\varphi)=\overline{v}(\varphi^*)$$
### Solution
Let $$S$$ be the set of wffs for which $$\overline{u}(\varphi)=\overline{v}(\varphi^*)$$. If $$\varphi = A_n$$, then $$\varphi^* = \alpha_n$$. Thus, since $$u(A_n) = \overline{v}(\alpha_n)$$ and $$\overline{u}$$ is an extension of $$u$$, we have that $$\overline{u}(A_n) = \overline{v}(\alpha_n)$$, i.e. $$\overline{u}(\varphi) = \overline{v}(\varphi^*)$$. Therefore, $$S$$ contains all sentence symbols. 

Now, I just need to show that $$S$$ is closed under the five sentence building operations.
Suppose $$\varphi$$ and $$\gamma$$ are members of $$S$$. Since $$\overline{u}(\varphi) = \overline{v}(\varphi^*)$$, we will have that $$\overline{u}((\lnot\varphi)) = \overline{v}((\lnot\varphi^*))$$ since $$\overline{u}$$ and $$\overline{v}$$ both adhere to the preestablished axioms for truth assignment extensions. Now since  $$\overline{v}((\lnot\varphi^*)) = \overline{v}((\lnot\varphi)^*)$$, we have that $$\overline{u}((\lnot\varphi)) = \overline{v}((\lnot\varphi)^*)$$, showing that $$(\lnot\varphi)\in S$$.

Let $$\square$$ denote one of $$\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow$$. Then $$\overline{u}(\varphi) = \overline{v}(\varphi^*)$$ and $$\overline{u}(\gamma) = \overline{v}(\gamma^*)$$ will imply that $$\overline{u}((\varphi\square\gamma)) = \overline{v}((\varphi^*\square\gamma^*))$$ by similar logic as above. But since $$(\varphi^*\square\gamma^*) = (\varphi\square\gamma)^*$$, we have that $$\overline{u}((\varphi\square\gamma)) = \overline{v}((\varphi\square\gamma)^*)$$, showing that $$(\varphi\square\gamma)\in S$$. 

Since $$S$$ contains all the sentence symbols and is closed under all sentence building operations, we conclude that $$S$$ is the set of all wffs by the induction principle. Therefore, for any wff $$\varphi$$, it will be that $$\overline{u}(\varphi) = \overline{v}(\varphi^*)$$.

## Part (b)
### Problem
Show that if $$\varphi$$ is a tautology, then so is $$\varphi^*$$.
### Solution
Let $$v$$ be an arbitrary truth assignment, and let $$u$$ be the truth assignment defined by $$u(A_n) = \overline{v}(\alpha_n)$$. Then by part (a) we know that $$\overline{u}(\varphi) = \overline{v}(\varphi^*)$$. Since $$\varphi$$ is a tautology, $$\overline{u}(\varphi) = T$$. Thus, $$\overline{v}(\varphi^*) = T$$. Since $$v$$ was arbitrary, it follows that $$\varphi^*$$ is a tautology.
