### Problem
Let $$\alpha$$ be a wff whose only connective symbols are $$\land,\lor,$$ and $$\lnot$$. Let $$\alpha^*$$ be the result of interchanging $$\land$$ and $$\lor$$ and replacing each sentence symbol by its negation. Show that $$\alpha^*$$ is tautologically equivalent to $$(\lnot\alpha)$$. Use the induction principle.
### Solution
Let $$S$$ be the set of wffs for which the desired property is true. Consider $$A$$ an arbitrary sentence symbol. Then $$A^* = (\lnot A)$$ Clearly $$A^*$$ is tautologically equivalent to $$(\lnot A)$$. Thus, $$A\in S$$, so $$S$$ contains all sentence symbols.

Now, suppose $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ are members of $$S$$. 
I want to show that $$(\lnot\alpha)\in S$$. Notice that $$(\lnot\alpha)^* = (\lnot(\lnot\alpha))$$. Clearly $$(\lnot\alpha)^*$$ is tautologically equivalent to $$(\lnot(\lnot\alpha))$$. Thus, $$(\lnot\alpha)\in S$$.

Now I will show that $$(\alpha\land\beta)\in S$$. Suppose that $$v$$ is a truth assignment which satisfies $$(\alpha\land\beta)^* = ((\lnot\alpha)\lor(\lnot\beta))$$. By the De Morgan's law tautology, $$v$$ must also satisfy $$(\lnot(\alpha\land\beta))$$, so that $$(\alpha\land\beta)^*$$ tautologically implies $$(\lnot(\alpha\land\beta))$$. On the other hand, let $$v$$ be a truth assignment which satisfies $$(\lnot(\alpha\land\beta))$$, then by the De Morgan's law tautology $$v$$ also satisfies $$((\lnot\alpha)\lor(\lnot\beta)) = (\alpha\land\beta)^*$$. Thus, $$(\lnot(\alpha\land\beta))$$ tautologically implies $$(\alpha\land\beta)^*$$. Therefore, $$(\alpha\land\beta)^*$$ and $$(\lnot(\alpha\land\beta))$$ are tautologically equivalent, meaning $$(\alpha\land\beta)\in S$$.

Now I will show that $$(\alpha\lor\beta)\in S$$. Suppose that $$v$$ is a truth assignment which satisfies $$(\alpha\lor\beta)^* = ((\lnot\alpha)\land(\lnot\beta))$$. By the De Morgan's law tautology, $$v$$ must also satisfy $$(\lnot(\alpha\lor\beta))$$, so that $$(\alpha\lor\beta)^*$$ tautologically implies $$(\lnot(\alpha\lor\beta))$$. On the other hand, let $$v$$ be a truth assignment which satisfies $$(\lnot(\alpha\lor\beta))$$, then by the De Morgan's law tautology $$v$$ also satisfies $$((\lnot\alpha)\land(\lnot\beta)) = (\alpha\lor\beta)^*$$. Thus, $$(\lnot(\alpha\lor\beta))$$ tautologically implies $$(\alpha\lor\beta)^*$$. Therefore, $$(\alpha\lor\beta)^*$$ and $$(\lnot(\alpha\lor\beta))$$ are tautologically equivalent, meaning $$(\alpha\lor\beta)\in S$$.

Since we are not interested in wffs which contain $$\to$$ or $$\leftrightarrow$$, we do not show that $$S$$ is closed under their respective sentence building operations.

By the induction principle, it follows that $$S$$ is the set of all wffs whose only connective symbols are $$\lnot,\to,$$ and $$\leftrightarrow$$. Thus, if $$\alpha$$ is a wff whose only connective symbols are $$\lnot,\to,$$ and $$\leftrightarrow$$, it will be that $$\alpha^*$$ and $$(\lnot\alpha)$$ are tautologically equivalent.
