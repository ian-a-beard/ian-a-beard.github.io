### Problem
Let $$\mathcal{S}$$ be the set of all sentence symbols, and assume that $$v:\mathcal{S}\to\{F,T\}$$ is a truth assignment. Show there is *at most* one extension $$\overline{v}$$ meeting conditions 0-5 listed at the beginning of this section.

### Solution
Suppose that $$\overline{v}_1$$ and $$\overline{v}_2$$ are both such extensions, and let $$X$$ be the set of wffs for which $$x\in X$$ iff $$\overline{v}_1(x) = \overline{v}_2(x)$$. Since $$\overline{v}_1$$ and $$\overline{v}_2$$ are extensions of the truth assignment $$v$$, we must have that $$\overline{v}_1(A)=\overline{v}_2(A)$$ for every sentence symbol $$A\in\mathcal{S}$$. Thus, $$X$$ contains all of the sentence symbols.

Now, suppose that $$\alpha,\beta\in\Sigma$$, so that $$\overline{v}_1(\alpha)=\overline{v}_2(\alpha)$$ and $$\overline{v}_1(\beta)=\overline{v}_2(\beta)$$. Since both $$\overline{v}_1$$ and $$\overline{v}_2$$ meet condition 0-5 listed at the beginning of the section, we must have that $$\overline{v}_1((\lnot\alpha)) = \overline{v}_2((\lnot\alpha))$$. Thus, $$(\lnot\alpha)\in S$$.

By conditions 0-5 we also have that \begin{gather}\overline{v}_1(\alpha\land\beta) = \begin{cases}T\quad\text{if } \overline{v}_1(\alpha)=T\text{ and }\overline{v}_1(\beta) = T\\ F\quad \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\end{gather}
\begin{gather}\overline{v}_2(\alpha\land\beta) = \begin{cases}T\quad\text{if } \overline{v}_2(\alpha)=T\text{ and }\overline{v}_2(\beta) = T\\ F\quad \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\end{gather}
Since $$\overline{v}_1(\alpha) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha)$$ and $$\overline{v}_1(\alpha) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha)$$. it must also be that $$\overline{v}_1(\alpha\land\beta) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha\land\beta)$$. Thus, $$(\alpha\land\beta)\in S$$, meaning $$S$$ is closed under $$\land$$. By similar reasoning, it is not difficult  to see that \begin{gather}\begin{gather}\overline{v}_1(\alpha\lor\beta) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha\lor\beta)\\ \overline{v}_1(\alpha\to\beta) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha\to\beta)\\ \overline{v}_1(\alpha\leftrightarrow\beta) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha\leftrightarrow\beta)\end{gather}\end{gather}
so that $$(\alpha\lor\beta),(\alpha\to\beta),(\alpha\leftrightarrow\beta)\in S$$. Since $$S$$ contains all the sentence symbols and is closed under $$\lnot,\land,\lor,\to,$$ and $$\leftrightarrow,$$ by the induction principle it must be that $$S$$ is the set of all wffs. Thus, for any wff $$\alpha$$, $$\overline{v}_1(\alpha) = \overline{v}_2(\alpha)$$. Therefore, $$\overline{v}_1=\overline{v}_2$$.
