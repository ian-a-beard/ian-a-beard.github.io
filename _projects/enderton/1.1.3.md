Let $$\alpha$$ be a wff; let $$c$$ be the number of places at which binary connective symbols $$(\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow)$$ occur in $$\alpha$$; let $$s$$ be the number of places at which sentence symbols occur in $$\alpha$$. (For example, if $$\alpha$$ is $$(A\to(\lnot A))$$ then $$c=1$$ and $$s=2$$.) Show by using the induction principle that $$s = c+1$$.

For an arbitrary formula $$\alpha$$, let $$s[\alpha]$$ denote the number of binary connective symbols which occur in $$\alpha$$, and let $$c[\alpha]$$ denote the numbber of places at which sentence symbols occur in $$\alpha$$.
Let $$S$$ denote the set of wffs such that if $$\alpha\in S$$ then $$s[\alpha] = c[\alpha] + 1$$.

The goal is to show that $$S$$ contains *all* wffs. To show this, I show that $$S$$ contains all the sentence symbols and is closed under all 5 sentence building operations. By the induction principle, this will mean that $$S$$ is the set of all wffs.

Consider $$A_i$$ an arbitrary sentence symbol. Since $$s[A_i] = 1$$ and $$c[A_i] = 0$$, it is clear that $$s[A_i] = c[A_i] + 1$$. Thus, $$A_i \in S$$ for all integers $$i\geq 1$$.

Now suppose that $$\alpha,\beta\in S$$. Then we have that $$s[\alpha] + s[\beta] = c[\alpha] + c[\beta] + 2$$. 
We consider $$(\alpha\square\beta)$$ where $$\square$$ is one of $$\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow$$.
Then $$s[(\alpha\square\beta)] = s[\alpha] + s[\beta]$$ and $$c[(\alpha\square\beta)] = c[\alpha] + c[\beta] + 1$$ 
The equation established earlier then implies that $$s[(\alpha\square\beta)] = c[(\alpha\square\beta)] + 1$$, so that $$(\alpha\square\beta)\in S$$ 

Therefore, by the induction principle, $$S$$ is the set of all wffs.
