Say that a set $$\Sigma_1$$ of wffs is *equivalent* to a set $$\Sigma_2$$ of wffs iff for any wff $$\alpha$$, we have that $$\Sigma_1\vDash\alpha$$ iff $$\Sigma_2\vDash\alpha$$. A set $$\Sigma$$ is *independent* iff no member of $$\Sigma$$ is tautologically implied by the remaining members in $$\Sigma$$. Show that the follow hold

## Part (a)
Claim: A finite set of wffs has an independent equivalent subset

To prove this, I will need to use the following lemma.

Lemma 1: If $$\Sigma=\{\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n\}\not\vDash\tau$$, then neither does $$\Sigma'=\{\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_{n-1}\}$$. 

Proof of lemma:
Let $$v$$ be a truth assignment which satisfies $$\Sigma$$ but for which $$\overline{v}(\tau)=F$$. Then $$v$$ also satisfies $$\Sigma'$$, but $$\overline{v}(\tau)=F$$ so that $$\Sigma'\not\vDash\tau$$.

Now I am ready to prove the original claim:

Let there be a finite set of wffs $$\Sigma_0 = \{\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n\}$$. 
Now, define $$\Sigma_{k+1}\subseteq\Sigma_k$$ by \begin{gather}\Sigma_{k+1} = \begin{cases}\Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\} \quad\text{   if } \Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}\vDash\sigma_{k+1}\\ \Sigma_k\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\end{gather}
So we have the following chain \begin{gather}\Sigma_n\subseteq\cdots\subseteq\Sigma_{k+1}\subseteq\Sigma_k\subseteq\cdots\subseteq\Sigma_1\subseteq\Sigma_0\end{gather}
I first show that $$\Sigma_n$$ is independent. Suppose $$\sigma_{k+1}\in\Sigma_n\subseteq\Sigma_{k+1}$$ for some $$k = 0,\ldots, n -1$$, then $$\Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}\not\vDash\sigma_k$$ by our construction. Since $$\Sigma_n\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}\subseteq \Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}$$, we have that $$\Sigma_n\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}\not\vDash\sigma_k$$ (by lemma1 ). Therefore, $$\Sigma_n$$ is independent.  

All that is left to show is that $$\Sigma_n$$ is equivalent to $$\Sigma_0$$. To show this, I will need to invoke the following lemma.

Lemma 2: Let $$\Sigma_n\subseteq\Sigma_0$$ be as constructed above, and suppose that $$v$$ is a truth assignment which satifies $$\Sigma_{k+1}$$ for $$k = 0,\ldots,n-1$$, then $$v$$ also satisfies $$\Sigma_k$$.

Proof of lemma 2:
Let $$v$$ be such a truth assignment satisfying $$\Sigma_{k+1}$$
Recall that $$\Sigma_{k+1}$$ is defined by \begin{gather}\Sigma_{k+1} = \begin{cases}\Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\} \quad\text{   if } \Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}\vDash\sigma_{k+1}\\ \Sigma_k\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\end{gather}
Obviously if $$\Sigma_{k+1}=\Sigma_k$$ then $$v$$ satisfies $$\Sigma_k$$. Assume the other case, that is $$\Sigma_{k+1} = \Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}\vDash\sigma_{k+1}$$. Then $$v$$ satisfies $$\sigma_{k+1}$$. Thus, $$v$$ satisfies $$\Sigma_k\setminus\{\sigma_{k+1}\}\cup\{\sigma_{k+1}\} = \Sigma_k$$. 

Now, we are in good shape to show that $$\Sigma_n$$ is equivalent to $$\Sigma_0$$.

First, let $$\alpha$$ be a wff such that $$\Sigma_n\vDash\alpha$$. Now, let $$v$$ be a truth assignment which satisfies $$\Sigma_0$$. Since $$\Sigma_n\subseteq\Sigma_0$$, $$v$$ also satisfies $$\Sigma_n$$. Thus, $$\overline{v}(\alpha) = T$$, so that $$\Sigma_0\vDash\alpha$$. 

On the other hand, suppose $$\alpha$$ is a wff such that $$\Sigma_0\vDash\alpha$$, and let $$v$$ be a truth assignment which satisfies $$\Sigma_n$$. By applying Lemma 2 repeatedly, we must also have that $$v$$ satisfies $$\Sigma_0$$, and thus $$\overline{v}(\alpha)=T$$. Thus, $$\Sigma_n\vDash\alpha$$.

Since $$\Sigma_n\vDash\alpha$$ iff $$\Sigma_0\vDash\alpha$$, the two sets are equivalent.

Therefore, $$\Sigma_n\subseteq\Sigma_0$$ is the independent equivalent subset desired.
## Part (b)
Claim: An infinite set need not have an independent equivalent subset

To show this, consider the following example.
Let $$\Sigma = \{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\ldots\}$$ where $$\alpha_1 = A_1$$, $$\alpha_2 = (A_1\land A_2)$$, and in general $$\alpha_{k+1} = (\alpha_{k}\land A_{k+1})$$, so that $$\Sigma = \{A_1,(A_1\land A_2),((A_1\land A_2)\land A_3),\ldots\}$$.

Suppose, for contradiction, that $$S\subseteq\Sigma$$ is independent and equivalent. It must be that $$S\neq\varnothing$$ since $$\varnothing$$ is not equivalent to $$\Sigma$$. This is true since $$\Sigma\vDash A_1\to A_2$$, but $$\varnothing\not\vDash A_1\to A_2$$. 

Now, I will show that $$\lvert S\rvert = 1$$. Suppose otherwise, that $$\alpha_i,\alpha_j\in S$$ where $$i<j$$. Then $$\alpha_j\vDash\alpha_i$$, so that $$S$$ is not an independent set of wffs. Thus, $$\lvert S\rvert = 1$$. So $$S = \{\alpha_k\}$$ for some $$k\in\mathbb{N}$$. It's obvious that $$\Sigma \vDash \alpha_{k+1}$$, so we should have that $$S\vDash\alpha_{k+1}$$. Let $$v$$ be a truth assignment so that $$v(A_1) = v(A_2) = \cdots = v(A_k) = T$$ and $$v(A_{k+1})= F$$. Then $$v$$ satisfies $$S = \{\alpha_k\}$$, but $$\overline{v}(\alpha_{k+1}) = F$$ showing that $$S\not\vDash\alpha_{k+1}$$, a contradiction. 

Therefore, $$\Sigma$$ does not have an independent equivalent subset.

## Part (c)
Let $$\Sigma = \{\sigma_0,\sigma_1,\ldots\}$$; show that there is an independent equivalent set $$\Sigma'$$.

I have not finished this one yet...
