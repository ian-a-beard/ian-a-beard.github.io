## Part (a)
### Problem
Is $$(((P\to Q)\to P)\to P)$$ a tautology?
### Solution
Yes, it is. To show this, we simply check the four possible truth assignment for $$P$$ and $$Q$$ 
\begin{gather}\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} 
P & Q & (P\to Q)& ((P\to Q)\to P) & (((P\to Q)\to P) \to P)\\
\hline 
T & T & T &T & T\\
T & F & F &T & T\\ 
F & T & T & F & T\\ 
F & F & T & F & T\\ 
\end{array} \end{gather}
Since the given formula is true given any truth assignment for $$P$$ and $$Q$$, we conclude it is indeed a tautology.

## Part (b)
### Problem
Define $$\sigma_k$$ recursively as follows: $$\sigma_0 = (P\to Q)$$ and $$\sigma_{k+1} = (\sigma_k\to P$$). For which value of $$k$$ is $$\sigma_k$$ a tautology?
### Solution
I will show that the only $$k$$ for which $$\sigma_k$$ is a tautology are the even $$k\geq 2$$.

Suppose that $$\sigma_k$$ is a tautology for some $$k$$, then we have the following truth table:
\begin{gather}\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} 
P & Q & \sigma_k& \sigma_{k+1}= (\sigma_k\to P) & \sigma_{k+2} = (\sigma_{k+1}\to P)\\
\hline 
T & T & T &T & T\\
T & F & T &T & T\\ 
F & T & T & F & T\\ 
F & F & T & F & T\\ 
\end{array} \end{gather}
The truth table reveals that $$\sigma_{k+2}$$ is also a tautology, and that $$\sigma_{k+1}$$ is not.

Since part (a) showed that $$\sigma_2$$ is a tautology, we then have that $$\sigma_4,\sigma_6,\sigma_8,\ldots$$ are tautologies, and that $$\sigma_3,\sigma_5,\sigma_7,\ldots$$ are not. 

All that is left to check are $$\sigma_0$$ and $$\sigma_1$$.
$$\sigma_0 = (P\to Q)$$ and $$\sigma_1 = ((P\to Q)\to P$$ are clearly not tautologies as showin in the truth table from part (a).

Therefore, the only $$k$$ for which $$\sigma_k$$ is a tautology are the even $$k\geq 2$$.
