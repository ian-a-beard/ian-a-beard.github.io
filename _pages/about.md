Hi! I'm Ian, a 21 year old American who has recently graduated from college. I intend for this website to become a place for me to share my writing and other projects. Currently, there are few recollections of recent travel stories available to read on my blog tab.

I'm sure this website will undergo several changes as I figure out what works best, but for now I encourage you to take a peek around. Thanks for visiting!
